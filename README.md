Adventures of Homebrew Smart Home
Having a smart home has been a dream I have had since 2003. My head was always briming with smart home ideas. Imagine if we could make our house understand us - wouldn't that be sweet? I got my first Arduino set in 2010, and it opened up a whole new world for me. For the first time, I was venturing into electronics, getting my hands dirty, on my own volition (and interest.) Smart home systems were costly back then, so I toyed with the idea of developing smart home modules targeted to hobbyist - low cost and low reliability but highly educational.

Alas - I didn't have the required skills, and life distractions got in the way.  

Fast forward to 2017. I joined [Melbourne Raspberry Pi Hackers] (https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Raspberry-Jam/) and found out about Node-red and it intrigued me. I decided to dust off a Raspberry Pi B+ from my store and boot it to live. Coupled with some ESP8266 modules that I have bought in the past, I decided to get my hands dirty once again.

Here is where I journal my road down the dirty, dirty adventures that I've had with Node-reed. Most of the contents are expected to be NSFI (Not safe for industry) and involves OTBT (off-the-beaten-track) practices that would make quality control engineers weep professional tears. 

But hey, some of us learn by making mistakes.
